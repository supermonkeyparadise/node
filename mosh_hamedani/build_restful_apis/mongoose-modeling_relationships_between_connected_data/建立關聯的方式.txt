 ** Trade off between query performance vs consistency **

[1] Using References (Normalization) -> CONSISTENCY
    let author ={
        name: 'Mosh'
    }

    let course = {
        author: 'id'
    }

[2] Using Embedded Document(Denormalization) -> PERFORMANCE
    let course = {
        author: {
            name: 'Mosh'
        }
    }

[3] Hybrid
    let author = {
        name: 'Mosh',
        // 50 other properties
    }

    let course = {
        author: {
            id: 'ref',
            name: 'Mosh'
        }
    }
